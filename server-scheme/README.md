# Server Schema

A very simple UML that prints out the resources of a server to serve websites and web systems.

Checks the https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer project. This project may shows the most fine web setup.

I will try to redo the schemes from the most basic, to something that I understand and attempt to reach the most efficient state.
